#### Code example: ####
*Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.*

*This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);*

*This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:*

* *100, if a grade for the exam is more than*
* *90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.*
* *90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.*
* *75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2*
* *0, in other cases*

```
function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  console.log(exam, projects);
  if (exam > 90 || projects > 10 ) {
    return 100;
} else if (exam > 75 && projects >= 5) {
   return 90;
} else if ( exam > 50 && projects >= 2) {
  return 75;
}
  else {
    return 0;
  }
}
